## Project Prelude

Inspired by online analyses, these projects explore a diverse range of data subjects. Emulating crucial elements, I seamlessly traversed through the intricacies, mirroring real-world scenarios. This journey empowered me to enhance and adapt my approach effectively.

This exploration finds its roots in practical experiences, where the need to extract insights from API-exported data in JSON format became a driving force. The techniques showcased in these projects have not only broadened my analytical capabilities but have also served as valuable tools for enriching analyses in scenarios involving JSON-formatted data from APIs.
## Project Overview

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my API Data Retrieval and JSON List Nesting project! This project focuses on fetching data from an API and processing JSON responses to create meaningful Pandas DataFrames. Explore the code and gain insights into effective data extraction and manipulation techniques.

## Data Retrieval from API using Requests

- Utilize the requests library to retrieve JSON data from an API endpoint.
- Employ Pandas to normalize JSON data into a structured DataFrame.

## JSON List Nesting and DataFrame Manipulation

- Explore techniques for handling nested JSON structures.
- Demonstrate Pandas' json_normalize function for different scenarios, including max level normalization, record path manipulation, and handling nested data structures.

## Interactive Data Visualization with Folium

- Leverage Folium to create an interactive map visualizing geospatial data.
- Customize markers based on data attributes such as magnitude, providing a clear overview.
